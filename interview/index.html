  My whole goal with the substack is that I don't know how to write... let me just see if I can convey these ideas with photos. I'd rather not write unless I feel like I really need to say something. <br>

  Writing can also be dangerous... <br>

  Totally...you gotta write everything with invisible ink. That reminds me of when I started doing all the Big Data stuff. If you download all the images and files, you might not want them forever. I didn't want to clog up people's computers, but at the same time I kinda wanted there to be this sense of urgency... to capture this moment in time. If you wanted to keep it you could, but if you didn't, it would automatically self-destruct. One of the things I couldn't find, but I know it has to exist, is a sort of file that has a shelf-life. So you could download two gigs of stuff and keep what you want in the pantry, but everything else is in the fridge... it has a quick shelf life. I'm sure it's out there. I love the idea of these files and images expiring. <br>

  Like planned obselescence. There is something kind of beautiful about how it sort of enforces change, in design. There's obviously plenty wrong with it too. <br>

  It can create nostalgia for the earlier version.<br>

  The refrigerator analogy is a perfect transition to my vision for this interview. I had a moment with an interiors/ lifestyle magazine the other day, one that usually inspires me that I'm exccited to dig into, where I thought... well, this is all very beautiful, but I would rather see these peoples' phones, or computers, or browser tabs. An 'interior' of a completely different nature, but an interior nonetheless. There's a metaphor there, it's kind of low-hanging fruit. But there it is... what would that house tour look like, is what I'm thinking about. <br>

  Let's do it. How about this... can you see my screen?<br>
  <i>Screen sharing is enabled. Caleb's desktop materializes suddenly; the Zoom window has automatically expanded and eclipsed the screen. A thick layer of gridded micro-icons blankets an image of what looks like a mountaneous peninsula with small islands sprinkled off its coast. The thumbnail icons, evenly spaced, are illegible and, in some cases, stacked.</i><br>
  CF <br>
  Most of my stuff is in the finder. This is just the spillover. Sometimes I'll clean it up. <br>
  <i>He "cleans up" the desktop area, and the grid is rejiggered. The cursor lands on a thumbnail in the upper left corner of the screen, highlighting it blue. <img src="../images/brokenimage.png"> An image of a truck appears in the middle of the screen. It is brown or maroon, with dual rear wheels and a sort of plywood and steel makeshift tailgate. The taillights, and license plate, are missing. <br></i>
  CF <br>
  This almost needs a disclaimer because I'm not sure what you're gonna find in here.

  Here's some old autographed Jamal Wilton's.<br>
