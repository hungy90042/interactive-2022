VOICES: CALEB FLOWERS (CF); CLAIRE HUNGERFORD (CH)<br>
DATE: 2.10.22<br>
LOCATION: SALT LAKE CITY, UT & NEW HAVEN, CT<br>
<br>
<div class="liner2">
[The two have spoken before. In the spring of 2020, Claire came across one of Caleb's many projects– 

<span class="reference" id="AA"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3"> Hathenbruck&trade;</a>
</span>– and purchased a pair of 
<span class="reference" id="BB"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3"> Chillbies</a></span>. It was around that time that Caleb started <span class="reference" id="BC"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3"> auctioning off ideas</a></span>. This left an impression on Claire, who began having ideas of her own that she would pitch to an imaginary audience in her head. After a trip to Moab, UT, she decided to record one of these pitches and sent it off to Caleb, whose <span class="reference" id="BD"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3"> contact</a></span> she located on one of his many sites. Caleb responded enthusiastically and invited Claire to auction off the idea collaboratively <span class="reference" id="CC"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">(IDEA_DROP_006).</a></span><br>
<br>
The following is a transcript of a conversation the two had over Zoom, two years later, in the winter of 2022. The recording begins mid-conversation. They're discussing 
<span class="reference" id="DD"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3"> Caleb's substack newsletter</a>
</span>, and the question of communicating via images versus text.]

<div class="transcription">
  <span class="speaker">
  CH:
</span>
I noticed the newsletter is all images, without any words.<br>
<br>
<span class="speaker">
  CF:
</span>
I've had issues trying to figure out how to convey my thoughts using words, and have the same message come across. With images, I've been able to do that a little bit better because it's more open to interpretation. But I also realize that sometimes I lose a lot... I kind of leave a lot of the messaging on the table. I think writing is super powerful in that way, and it's something that I wish I knew how to do better.<br>
<br>
<span class="speaker">
  CH:
</span>
Maybe we don't necessarily need text. With those images you sent [in your substack] you're already in a way writing in that you're creating a sequence of images. Seems right that there aren't words or captions.<br>
<br>
<span class="speaker">
  CF:
</span>
Maybe silent era movies are coming back in...CDs too. You know what I mean? Because maybe we were talking too much, like, maybe there's too much communication. My whole goal with the substack is like, OK, I don't know how to write. Let me just see if I can convey it with photos. And so far so good. I've actually had way more fun. I'm kind of like, [how about] don't write unless I really feel I need to say something.<br>
<br>
<span class="speaker">
  CH:
</span>
Writing can also feel a bit permanent too.<br>
<br>
<span class="speaker">
  CF:
</span>
Totally. You got to, like, write everything in invisible ink.<br>
<br>
<span class="speaker">
  CH:
</span>
Haha, totally.<br>
<br>
<span class="speaker">
  CF:
</span>
This reminds me of when I started doing all the <span class="reference" id="EE"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3"> Big Data</a></span> stuff. If you download all these images and these words and these ideas, you might not want them forever and they might clog up people's computers. But at the same time, I kind of wanted there to be a sense of urgency– [capturing] a specific moment in time that– if you wanted to keep it, you could. But if you didn't, it would automatically self-destruct. So I was looking for a file that had a shelf life. Or, if you saw something you wanted to keep, you could throw it into the uh, the… what’s it called?<br>
<br>
<span class="speaker">
  CH:
</span>
The refrigerator?<br>
<br>
<span class="speaker">
  CF:
</span>
Yeah, the refrigerator. Or the pantry. And all the rest automatically go to the recycle bin and delete. I’m sure it's out there.<br>
<br>
<span class="speaker">
  CH:
</span>
That’s a great idea.<br>
<br>
<span class="speaker">
  CF:
</span>
I love the idea that just maybe not everything's out there forever.<br>
<br>
<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
Yeah, kind of like planned obsolescence. Which has kind of a bad rap… it generates an untenable amount of waste. It’s way more complicated than I’m qualified to get into [haha]. But the idea…there's something interesting about how it mandates change. And how this refresh of physical objects creates nostalgia for the previous version. Thinking about the rounded corners of the <span class="reference" id="E2"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">iPhone2.</a></span><br><br>
<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
Totally. I love stories, I love products, I love product stories. I’m almost convinced people rolling product out is just a giant hero story. The product gets iterated on, and then it gets to come back. You know what I mean? Like the hero's journey of the iPhone. It's like, hey, we need to stay at this shape because it's clearly the best…but to stay here, we have to leave for a moment. That will allow us to tell the story… to demonstrate how we have the humility to return back to the best shape. And we’ll sell all these phones along the way. <br><br>
<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
It’s <span class="reference" id="E3"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">the Odyssey.</a></span><br><br>
<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
Haha, totally. Every product story is basically like “Hey, we overbuilt it, but we learned from our mistakes and we're continually evolving, and we’re back [at this shape] even though we could have use kept going.” You know what I mean?<br><br>

I’ve gotten to the position where I’m not sure where the value is [in saving images]. But there’s obviously value in it...I’ve been able to do conceptual design for companies based on these concepts using images, clothing for example. I’d never really thought of it as an artistic endeavor. But it turns out that people are looking at it that way, which I find fascinating. But it’s getting harder and harder to find good stuff. I continually have to change my formula to find where I’m getting that inspiration from. Which has become a little bit of an evolution of myself as well.<br><br>

I used to go to eBay and find cool stuff, and I still do, but people on eBay all collect the same ironic vintage coffee cups. Now I feel like it’s not enough...even though five years ago I’d have been like, Oh my God, this is all the graphic inspo I could possibly need. I can’t tell if it’s me that’s changing or if it’s the sites that are changing.<br><br>

Once I had these these two young kids, Henry Sulki (who I think is going to Boulder) and Mike The Ruler who... I don’t know if you ever knew Mike, but Mike was the young fashion kid when Hood By Air and all that was coming out. He was super young, on the cover of everything. They both somehow ended up in Park City. And of course, at the time, I was the only fashion source there, so they would come in and just hang out, tell me what brands I should get in <span class="reference" id="E4"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">the shop</a></span>...I’d kind of babysit them at the store for a minute or whatever. I would watch them interact. And this is maybe like eight years ago. They’re probably in the 20s now, but they would give eachother their phones and go through one another’s photos to see what they were saving. I was like, Whoa, that’s wild. So different from the idea of social media, exchanging phones with a person and taking a look.<br><br>

I find this concept of just ‘putting out’ your phone, or your desktop, at a certain point really fascinating.<br><br>
<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
Hmm. Which is basically what you were doing with Big Data.<br><br>
<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
Sure, but mine was rough. It was rough and quick... and the people that grasped the concept grasped it. But if I could have polished it up a bit where it was more digestible, I think people would have understood it more.<br><br>
<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
Why do you save stuff?<br><br>
<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
I save an image or a website because I don’t know if I’m going to find this thing again. I can bookmark it, but who knows if the site will stay up. So there’s this fear of losing it forever. I’m somewhat loss-averse.<br><br>

I’m more likely to save stuff that I find in unexpected places. You could call it the “thrill of the hunt.” That’s why Instagram is out, because they’re pushing you all the same stuff. But finding something in an unexpected place online or wherever makes it more memorable and more valuable. If I come across an RV on a random RV forum, how I got there is just as important as the photo of the RV that I saved itself. I screenshotted one and then I “searched by image”, and suddenly I came up on this crazy RV subculture. And now I’m just like in pure bliss.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
It seems like you go down the rabbit hole, then you emerge with a kind of fixation on some existing thing from some unexpected place, then you interate. I’ve noticed that you really do leverage the doctrine of fair-use, if that makes sense. The law <span class="reference" id="E5"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">(which is being defined as we speak)</a></span> does protect you in this process (up to a certain point), because it recognizes that this is how the culture develops. You’ve mentioned this in <span class="reference" id="E6"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">previous interviews</a></span>: what we want is actually what’s familiar to us, but with a slight tweak. So it’s this kind of alchemy that you’ve achieved that I wanted to talk to you about.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
I don’t think ideas are summoned. <span class="reference" id="E60"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">They come from somewhere</a></span>. The artists I love are the ones that do that, and unselfconsciously and openly take people on a journey back to that original inspiration. Andy Warhol and Richard Prince, for example. This idea of narrating a thing that already exists. Imagine someone on Youtube narrating a football game. How can they talk about sports and show this footage that has already been widely broadcasted, like the NFL, and not get it taken off Youtube? That’s because they’re narrating, adding their layer, adding their 3%, so they’re protected. There’s this art to it.<br><br>

A lot of my products are developed from asking the question, how can I take this familiar thing and tell my story on top of it? It’s a rubber boot, which we all know, but a different story layered on top of it. I’m fascinated with that art of saying, Hey, look, these people don’t want a different product. <br><br>

People already know this– how receptive everyone is to this product-storytelling... I’m convinced that most products hitting the market (including mine) will essentially start at the end, and then post-justify to create the story, and fill in the blanks to get there.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
You mean try to create a story out of a product or object that already exists? Like they’ve already made the product, then they’re fabricating a story about it.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
Yeah, like look: we have this product, and it’s a good product, but no one needs it and they don’t have any reason to need it, or if they want it they don’t know why they want it... and so suddenly the company needs to invest in the story of how they arrived at the product. And they’ve learned that that actually is more important than the product itself. It’s classic– the struggle is the point.<br><br>

So now people are engineering the “struggle” of building a product. I see kids on Instagram, they’re like, “It took me four months to find the perfect [whatever]...” Haha. They show all the trims, but I’m like... I know you had your sample months ago.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
Totally. I think we’re starting to be able to sniff that stuff out.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
Of course. So brands are starting to find creative ways of subverting this timeline. Damn, this really reminds me of this video I have to send you. It’s some performance art. It’s this video on Instagram that I come across. I don’t know how to explain it other than, like, “what are we watching here?” Looks like it’s in Atlanta or something, maybe like Kentucky. It looks like an old old apartment complex, like where I where I used to live. Everyone’s out front. One car just suddenly T-bones another car, and the airbags go off. Guys get out and they’re arguing, and the filmer is moving around... he comes around to the front, and he’s saying “what is going on here? What is going on here?” He pops his trunk and this guy in a football suit gets out of the back and he’s doing like this kind of like interpretive, like football-celebration-dance. And he’s got full on football gear, and this big band is playing. I thought I was watching a car accident in front of a house. But it’s an art piece. There’s both production value and no production value. I’m like, what is this for? Is this a birthday party? Did you guys choreograph this? It’s done so well, but it’s done so lo-fi, and it’s so believable since it’s it seems very spontaneous.<br><br>

And so lately, as far as finding ideas, I’ve been wondering how to do what that video does so successfully, in a way. Making it not about the product. Not even showing the product. Just doing something that captivates people and somehow they hopefully they want to learn more about the idea.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
Let’s go back to the refrigerator analogy… it happens to be a good transition to an idea I had for this interview. I had a moment with an interiors/ lifestyle magazine the other day, one that usually inspires me that I'm excited to dig into, where I thought... well, this is all very beautiful, but I would rather see these peoples' phones, or computers, or browser tabs. Another kind of interior. There’s the metaphor I guess, it's kind of low-hanging fruit. So in your case, what would that house tour look like? Which brings me to: will you take me on a tour of your computer? Anything really… your desktop, your Finder, your tabs, wherever you’re saving stuff you come across. Where do you save stuff? Do you take notes?<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
Well, I’m very disorganized. I’ll tell a quick story about my dad and then I’ll show you my desktop. My dad was a siding contractor. He'd be building walls, and as he was doing this, he'd also be taking phone numbers down for a new potential job that we could possibly go to to measure up. Me and my brother would be doing the siding down below, he'd be on the ladder up above. And he'd be on his phone, you know, 'Okay...give me your number, what's your name, how many square feet, Saturday...' handwriting all of this info directly on the on the Tyvek wall. Me and my brother, while he was distracted talking to the subcontractor, finished the entire building [installing the walls above the Tyvek]. So we had to rip all siding off, just get the phone number. It took three more days to finish the job. Now we'd just like, take a photo of it or whatever.<br><br>
So that was my dad. Lots of thoughts and responsibilities, and sometimes they're deep in there... not necessarily easy to get to. <br><br>
<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
Encrypted in a way.<br><br>
<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
Yeah. So my desktop, basically no one can navigate it but me because it's so cluttered. It's basically encrypted. Okay let's do it... can you see my screen?<br>

[Screen sharing is enabled. <span class="reference" id="E7"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">Caleb's desktop</a></span> materializes suddenly; the Zoom window has automatically expanded and eclipsed the screen. A thick layer of gridded micro-icons blankets an image of what looks like a mountaneous peninsula with small islands sprinkled off its coast. The thumbnail icons are evenly spaced, entirely illegible and stacked above one another in piles reminiscent of an Escher-like labyrinth, or an Indian stepwell.]
</p></div></div>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
Most of my stuff is in the finder in folders. This is just the spillover. Sometimes I'll clean it up as a way of mixing it up.<br>

<div class="liner"><div class="liner2">
<p>  
[He <span class="reference" id="E8"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">“cleans up”</a></span> the desktop area (VIEW > CLEAN UP BY > KIND) and the grid dramatically recalibrates. The cursor lands on a thumbnail in the upper left corner of the screen, highlighting it in blue. An image of a truck appears in the middle of the screen. It is brown or dark burgundy, with dual rear wheels and a sort of plywood and steel makeshift tailgate. The taillights, and license plate, are missing. </p></div></div>

This almost needs a disclaimer because I'm not sure where you going to find it here. Some Jamaal Wilkes'.<br>

Propped against the shoebox is a <span class="reference" id="E9"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">certificate of authenticity</a></span>].<br><br>

[Caleb begins rapidly clicking through images.]</p></div></div>
<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
My desktop feels like a very large table with images scattered out on it.<br><br>

[A pair of sneakers in ecru, red and navy blue appear above a white background.  It seems they’ve been sliced diagonally along their uppers, removing the laces and tongue of the shoes. In their place is a gray felted material attached to the sneakers using a thick oversized chainstitch. In this way, they’re a sort of sneaker/slipper hybrid.]</p></div></div>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
It’s kind of interesting that I pulled the photo. I don't actually think the styling or anything is that good. I guess I pulled it because it was the first thing that turned up a Google search.

                                      <! SCREENSHOT 1>

<div class="liner"><div class="liner2">
<p>
[A <span class="reference" id="F2"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">screenshot</a></span> of a living space appears.]</p></div></div>
<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
We're looking at an image now of what appears to be a living room…I know where it's taken, but if you didn't know where it was taken, it would look like you were in the Pacific Northwest. There’s a large window with maybe some fern trees.<br><br>
<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
And like a tent is pitched outside…<br><br>
<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
That is a tent. It's funny because I didn't even see that until you said that. Now I can't unsee it. Maybe some old hemlocks, cedars or something old growth. Very cool. I found it on a web site, a real estate website. And the best thing about real estate websites, especially in obscure locations, is most of the people are taking [the photos] on old digital cameras. So the treatment is different right away. It's not…they don't have a marketing team coming in and shooting them on a Canon 60d. What I would think of it as, maybe the local newspaper photographer also kind of moonlights as a real estate photographer, you know, on the weekends because it feels kind of like that. It's not a bad photo as far as quality or anything. It's just different and less polished than what you would see, you know, in New York or Park City or L.A. or wherever it may be. So I'm interested in it because of that. The other thing is a lot of these off-the-beaten-path real estate companies aren't staging their properties, so you're not seeing the same type of furniture and the same kind of kind of fluffed up interiors.<br><br>

It feels real, and a lot of them just feel like the main goal is to get the photo of the space, not sell the idea of what the space is. It’s more like they're documenting the space, you know what I mean, and documenting how it's lived. And so because of that, I find it super interesting. So there's the mash-up of this…I got to explain also the photo of this space… there’s unfinished walls, there’s some artwork hanging on the walls, and then it looks almost like a second home or a vacation home of someone who's maybe trying to turn it into their full residency or who is living in a trailer next to this residency. And they're living in it, just based on the mash-up of furniture and the complete, I don't know, carefree selection of furniture almost feels like it's artistic. And more like “hey, we need a…a dining room table. It doesn't matter how it looks. We just need a table or we need a chair. It doesn’t matter what chair it is, that's a good corner for a chair. So because of that, we have this mash up of this leather riveted, almost tufted leather chair in the corner. Not necessarily lazy boy. What would you call that like? Almost like a…<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
It looks like a like a cartoon drawing of a leather chair, like an armchair.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
Looks very comfortable, and it also looks kind of like sat-in. Then there's a couch with with a kind of a foot pedestal that doesn't match, but looks like it matches, but it doesn’t. It's tufted and maybe from a different era. But almost similar in color. So like if that was the deciding factor [for these people], it doesn't matter if it matches, all that matters is that the color is similar to look like a full set. And I like that thinking too. You know, it doesn't have to be by the same designer or anything like that. They're similar in color, so that's good enough for me.<br><br>

A wooden living room table. It looks like the wood has been planed to make these kind of benches. These bench seats. And then the lighting…very interesting, maybe more of an artistic touch is this stained glass, maybe handprinted pane glass of blue and like royal blue with a kind of an ornate...<br><br> 

<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
Kind of Tiffany, but probably not.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
And it almost kind of lends itself to the <span class="reference" id="F3"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">art that's hanging on the wall</a></span>. It looks like it’s almost in some sort of photo box or something.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
Yeah, it's so weird because it's doing the thing that the the unfinished walls are doing…like it has this like dimension, like a window. What is that called?<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
The walls have kind of this weird inset, and the same thing with this piece of art, like it's inset, but it's got this kind of sculptural, sculptural, copper kind of gold–what I would say looks like a horse, kind of a Trojan-esque–in the middle of a kind of dark green velvet backing. So it goes with the unfinished walls and the unfinished rafters in a weird way. <br><br>

But then my favorite part about this is there's like a RCA old radio and a solo cup and kind of a less thought-out, day-to-day, lived-in kind of accoutrement.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
The antenna on the boombox is pointed at a, I would say, a 45 degree angle. So we know they’re trying to get a signal. <br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
And it's pointed towards the window. The windows got like a sheet, kind of like a bed sheet up that looks like it's maybe gray. But as the sun shines through the window, that gray turns almost to this turquoise that makes it almost look very late 80s, early 90s in my mind, you know, like a late 80s, early 90s beachfront hotel room kind of thing.<br><br>

I don't know. The whole mash up of all of it together is is fascinating to me. And then to think that its the Pacific Northwest, you gotta wonder, “who lives here?”. There's also an <span class="reference" id="F4"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">oil lamp</a></span> laying in there. So that mash up with the electric lamp is all interesting to me.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
And a flashlight…that bright green flashlight. So many different centuries of technology…haha.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
Yeah, it's this assortment. There’s no…I don’t want to say respect, but there's no attention or not attention…they show no qualms about mixing stuff, which I think is artistic, which tells me this person, probably like…the first thing is having a spot to live in peace and to put their things on the walls. And they need to be around the things that they like. And there isn't an era for that. It's not curated. It's not only mid-century...<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
It’s just humane. It’s like humanity. Like, that's their guiding principle.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
Exactly. It feels like they're kind of grabbing stuff as they go along, day by day. It doesn't feel like they went out with this contrived idea of like, this is who I am. This is this place I live in. All these things seem to be collected individually day by day, and this is where they all landed and they live together in this room. So they curated it, but not as an overall concept. They curated as a point, I mean a point in their lives or a day in their life, and then brought it home and mixed it all together. So I think that's creative and artistic, and the mash-up makes it also like, I don't know, very hard to duplicate, which gives it value in my mind. Like, you couldn't just go out and recreate this whole setting and try to explain what we just explained to an interior decorator.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
Kind of untouchable, and un-shoppable.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
I don't know, it comes back to: what is value, and why do things have value? In my mind, it's how hard it would be to recreate them or come across them again. And I think that that also factors into why we screenshot stuff…we don't think we're going to come across it again and we don’t think we're going to find it again because it's hard to recreate. Though you could recreate this…it would be hard to do it and still have the same effect. We would know that it was re-created or done over time or done without the intent of it being cool. And I think that's a lot with music and artists and anything that I kind of come across. It's like, Oh, this guy. I mean, Daniel Johnson's the perfect thing where people were like, what is this guy doing? And now he’s like, cult classic.<br><br>

So that's one photo, it’s of somebody who's an interior decorator and doesn't know it, or does interior design and doesn't know it or potentially like… this could be an Acne Studios retail store. You know what I mean, kind of meta and off the wall (and it’s a little clutter for that), but it could definitely be that. Or be pulled as Inso for that. And I find that fascinating.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
The second image we're looking at, the constant that is similar to the first one is that it's unfinished. This one has <span class="reference" id="FF1"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">insulation</a></span>, so there’re no exposed rafters. But the advertising of the insulation is faced out and it's this kinda cool “JM” allover print insulation that runs through the roof. However, the walls are finished with a gray drywall, and it feels it feels almost 80s between the curtains, the drywall…kind of these 80s Florida…there’s a dining room table with these four roller chairs around it, but it's got this kind of like fluorescent, black, magenta… almost feels like a 80s hotel wallpaper Scarface- kinda vibe to it. You know what I mean? But it's mashed with plywood, and this old barbecue maybe that’s in the living room. And a mini fridge with this weird angel decal on it. But all these elements are combined to make this really great…I don't know. I love the design of it, and I just think that it would be really hard to recreate this even if you had a vision because the stuff is so eccentric, right?<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
Right… part of [the question of] what to do with inspiration is identifying the elements that are most striking so that you might channel them into something else. Like when I see this, like the first thing I saw was like these overlapping rectangles of what's happening on the floor like that is something that like, really brings me back to like my mom's apartment. How she just like didn't have the same concern about like like the rugs which were, like a bunch of Persian hand-me-down rugs. The furniture on top of them were never was never really respectful of the boundaries of the rugs and that it was a bit bizarre. Now I see people using rugs as a way of like, you know, creating boundaries. But like this, how it's just totally random and overlapping, I guess, of surfaces…<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
They show no disregard for breaking the rules of regular rug design or rules for what a runner is or whatever. And I think that that's the same appeal for me as well. And then I look at it and I think, like I said, you start to learn more about yourself as you’re collecting more images or whatever. So I've realized I like a lot of these <span class="reference" id="F5"><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/"  target="iframe3">unfinished</a></span> spaces.<br><br>

I also don't finish a lot of projects. So I justify them as well, no, it is finished because I don't have to finish it. And that's actually not the product, because if it's finished, that means that there was this end goal or intent and it's actually already doing what it meant to be. So the only reason I need to finish it is for someone else's approval, or for it to feel like a finished product. And to me, if I'm using it, it's a finished project. So in my mind, taking that and realizing that I love all these unfinished spaces…this perfect person is living in this space, they're making food, they’re living here…And there's also this kind of– like I said, I don't know if it's positive or negative–but there's also this fun element of what it could still be. And I think that allows people like me or you or whoever to say, Oh, it kind of reminds me of this or that, you know, photo or book or sweatshirt, you know. You could also, you know, cut the hood off and it would look more like this.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
So it’s more generative. <br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
Yeah, it leaves a little bit more of this open-ended non-resolution thing, which people with OCD hate because it doesn't feel like an end product… it doesn't feel like the movie had a good ending. But I love the idea because it creates the dialog of like, “are you going to finish to the ceiling?” or “what color is it going to be? Are you going to do a chandelier? What are you thinking for the floors?” So there's always this constant conversation and dialog around things that are perceived as finished or unfinished now. Making sure they're functional is a whole nother thing. And that would be the defining point of: did you stop too short? You know, if it's not functional, maybe you stopped a little bit too short, but the sweet spot is between having the functionality and having a space you can live in that keeps you warm, safe and dry, or whatever it is, and then aesthetically finishing it just so you can check a box. I like to dabble in that zone somewhere.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CH:</span>
Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br><br>

<span class="speaker">CF:</span>
And so when I collect all these images or whatever you to call it, catalog them or whatever, that's just one thing I’ve noticed…that I feel very free around spaces that are unfinished, and [I feel] very comfortable. Or I guess traditionally what would be perceived as a “finished” interior. In my mind, this is finished. Maybe not the barbecue grill in the living room, but this idea of this fully creative living suite that functions different, is kinda fun and out of the norm. I don't know. Some people might say it's it's a little bit crazy, but I have a lot of these. So like I said, I don't know what it says about me, but I do know I like it.<br>
