    <h1>Every Morning</h1>
    <div>
Every morning there's a halo hangin' from the corner<br>
Of my girlfriend's four-post bed<br> 
I know it's not mine but I'll see if I can use it<br>
For the weekend or a one-night stand<br>
<br>
Couldn't understand<br>
How to work it out<br>
Once again as predicted, left my broken heart open<br>
And you ripped it out<br>
<br>
Something's got me reelin'<br>
Stopped me from believin'<br>
Turn me around again<br>
Said that we can do it<br>
You know I wanna do it again<br>
<br>
<em>Oh<br>
(Every morning) oh<br>
(Every morning when I wake up)<br>
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)<br>
Oh (she always rights the wrong)<br>
Oh (she always rights, she always rights)<br>
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)</em><br>
<br>
Every morning there's a heartache hanging from the corner<br>
Of my girlfriend's four-post bed<br>
I know it's not mine and I know she thinks she loves me<br>
But I never can believe what she said<br>
<br>
Something so deceivin'<br>
When you stop believin'<br>
Turn me around again<br>
Said we couldn't do it<br>
You know I wanna do it again<br>
<br>
<em>Oh<br>
(Every morning) oh<br>
(Every morning when I wake up)<br>
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)<br>
Oh<br>
(Every morning) oh<br>
(Every morning when I wake up)<br>
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)</em><br>
<br>
<b>She always rights the wrong<br>
For me, baby<br>
She always rights the wrong<br>
For me</b><br>
