  In a photograph from 1963 inside the newly-constructed Beinecke Library,* a visitor gazes upon the Gutenberg Bible before the backdrop of the library’s sprawling bookstacks. Its composition supports the prevalent narrative that surrounds the Gutenberg: this one book is the source of all books. 
This triad—the visitor, the “Book”, and “all books”—inspired a series of interviews I conducted with Beinecke visitors in that same area where the man is standing.
What resulted was an experimental crowd-sourced appraisal of the Gutenberg Bible, an object whose “value” (financial, symbolic, historical) was suddenly, according to those visitors, far more maleable, and far less stable, than the official language surrounding this object suggests. During these conversations, multiple narratives were at work: the narrative of scripture, the historical narrative of the Gutenberg Bible as a rare and valuable artifact, and the (often inadvertent) ways the Bible creates narratives around itself.

I learned that the Gutenberg’s pages are turned, by a conservator, Rebecca Hatcher, every three-or-so weeks, for the health of the spine. It’s like the Gutenberg is on life support.  

I coded a website that splits the transcript of all the interviews (and the text of the Old and New Testaments of the Bible as marginalia) into 648 pages: the same number of pages as the Gutenberg. It is connected to a spreadsheet that the conservator, Rebecca, changes when she turns a page of the Gutenberg. It’ll then (thanks to Neeta’s help) then automatically print the page.

At this rate, Life Support will take about twenty years to print in its entirety.
