What are your names?
I�m Zaria  
I�m Reijel 
Have you ever seen a Gutenberg Bible before? 
No... 
No, not in person.
Did you come here to see this?
I did. [laughs]
We came for a couple things, but we did specifically want to see it, yeah.
Did you each have relationships with bibles in your past?
I mean kind of, yeah. 
For me it�s more of the book aspect of it, and how, obviously, the Gutenberg [came up with] what eventually became the printing press and started mass printing. 
I think it�s more about that for me than it is [about] the bible part. 
I would say I�m kind of the exact opposite, because I was raised religious. 
So it is [about] the Bible aspect for me. 
But I�m not religious anymore. 
So it�s not like...deeply emotional. 
But it is really interesting to see what we know now and how different it is from what we had before, and the changes that [have been] made. 
And obviously I can�t sit here and read it, but it�s still interesting to see just how much it has evolved. 
It�s also interesting to me how similar it is, graphically, to the bibles we know today. 
And so from a book design, or book-as-object perspective, what do you think about it?
We were talking about this earlier, actually...[laughs]. 
I�m a big history person, so it�s like, even before this, most of the people who had access to the bible were priests, people with copious amounts of money, a lot of them were written in old Latin, which a lot of people couldn�t read. 
How Gutenberg printing the Bible gave more people access, which ended up kicking off� or at least contributing to� the Protestant Reformation and the splintering of the church and everything. 
How it had a huge impact on modern history. 
How about for you [Zaria], as someone who has had a relationship with the bible?
I do have somewhat of a negative relationship with the bible, so I do have a part of me that�s like, �Man, wouldn�t that be interesting if this just didn�t happen?� 
Like, how different my life would be if...
...if this was an empty box?
Exactly, or if this box just wasn�t even here, you know. 
Or how religion might have been more close-knit, or harder-to-get-into, because it wouldn�t have reached so many people? 
Or what if the only people who had bibles were those priests, and those higher-up, and royalty. 
Obviously a lot of it that we have now has been changed because of what has been taken out, and what has been left in, or whatever. 
But because so many people were able to get a hold of the bible, they were able to have discussions about it, talk about it...common people wouldn�t have been able to do that. 
How we would know religion today...how different it would be...it would have been more...controlled.
The story, the narrative of the bible.
Yes. 
How much harder it would have been, how much more difficult it would have been for common people to have a clear understanding of it. 
Or to be empowered by it. 
Yes, exactly.

What are your names?
My name is Gareth.
I�m Keith.
Did you come here to see the Gutenberg Bible?
We came to see the John James Audubon illustrations. 
Figured we might as well stop by�and see the ol� Gutenberg too [laughs].
Have you ever seen a Gutenberg Bible before?
Uh� none other than this one.
Do you have a relationship with bibles in your past?
Yeah, you could say that. 
My family kept a King James Bible. 
I can�t say I have more of a relationship than that.
I grew up in the church, so I was always reading bibles. 
I read through the entire bible. 
The international version. 
But I�ve never really experienced different translations of it. 
How does it feel, looking at this one?
Very, very cool. 
I dunno, I�ve never seen anything like this before. 
Does anything in particular stand out to you?
I dunno, I don�t understand any Latin whatsoever [laughs]. 
So it�s just cool to see it and try to understand the history around it. 
I like the script and I like the flowers around it too. 
It�s well-decorated. 
Not like all the bibles we have to read today, where it�s just letters and pages. 

What's your name?
I'm John.
Is this your first time seeing a Gutenberg bible?
Yeah. 
I mean, it�s pretty amazing to see something that was printed for the first time, on this continent.
The fact that it�s a bible is even more fascinating. 
Do you have a relationship with bibles?
Yeah, I�m a Christian. 
Is it a special experience, seeing it?
Yeah, I mean� we drove to this university for this purpose. 
To see this.
Is there anything about it that you noticed or found surprising?
I wouldn�t say I was surprised, it�s just the fact that� I guess it�s like looking at anything else that�s either the first of its kind, or something that�s old that existed before you, or your parents, or even your grandparents sometimes. 
It fascinates you in a way.
Like an aura?
I wouldn�t say an aura� it�s like walking into an old church, you see it was build two maybe three hundred years ago, without any modern equipment, and you�re like, how did they do it? 
It fascinates you. 
Right now, we have everything at our fingertips. 
Printing something takes just the press of a button. 
This took big machines, they had to put letters in my hand and put ink down. 
So each page took an effort. 

What's your name?
My name is Lee.
Is this your first time seeing a Gutenberg bible?
You know, I�m trying to figure that out! 
Because I was in London about ten or fifteen years ago, and I think there was a copy. 
But I can�t really pin it down. 
I don�t think it�s the first time. 
But it�s striking, nonetheless.
Do you have a prior relationship with bibles?
Well, yes. 
A personal relationship.
Can you describe that striking quality?
I love books. 
The idea that this is the first one printed with movable type� that this is the start of all the books I�ve ever read in my life� is amazing. 
And it�s amazing that it�s here for all of us to see. 
Right, this part of the Bienecke is open to the public.
Right! 
You can just walk in. 
I will say that the main relationship I have with the bible is�even as a child I remember reading �in the beginning was the word.� 
And that had tremendous meaning for me as a sort of wordy child. 


What are your names?
I'm Xerxes.
I'm Ynes.
Is this the first time you�ve seen a Gutenberg bible?
No, in the city.
At the Morgan?
Yes!
And do either of you have prior relationships with bibles?
Bibles in general? 
Yes.
Not me.
How does it feel seeing a Gutenberg bible, as someone who has a relationship to bibles?
Well, I�m no longer religious, so I see it as a part of history. 
I really see Gutenberg bibles as a momentous turn in history. 
This shift in literacy as well as accessibility. 
Which is obviously what they are. 
I don�t think I could fully appreciate to the extent that someone who is an art historian can, but I learned about them through a class on Byzantine art. 
Which is funny because it�s not Byzantine. 
But it was the first time they mentioned a bible. 
And this shifted once the Gutenberg bible was made. 
And then of course I learned about it again through European history. 
So I look at it as a symbol of what changed history. 
The Gutenberg Bible is one of those things that changed history. 
One thing is that bibles are so reproduced now. 
All the more reason that the original is more desired, because reproducibility is so easy now with electronic media, that you really desire to see something singular. 
If this started off the printing revolution� as humans wanting to see original things, the more rare.
Really, the text is the text. 
We want the analogue. 
The way that this fits right in� and the reason they talked about it in a class that had nothing to do with it�
The Byzantine art class?
Yes� because this was all you could do, is write things down. 
Make an icon. 
How you communicate religious belief without text. 
And now we�ve got text. 
Text that didn�t rely on a translator. 
It still does, but you could get more, as you said� it�s reproducible, so therefore there�s a certain faith in it. 
It�s like saying I know what the other person is reading. 
They�re reading this. 
I�m reading this. 
And now� sorry, I know you were going to say something sweetie� but now, there�s a way in which, back then, that was an incredible feeling to have a communal understanding based on reading the exact same thing as someone else. 
But it was translated into the vernacular, right?
That�s right� which is also what allowed people to feel like more than one person is understanding what I�m reading at the same time as I am.
It�s like the seed of mass production of texts.
Is it important that [the text] was the bible?
Yeah, for westerners it had particular�
Resonance? Currency?
Yeah, more than that, more than currency.
Almost like the DNA of western civilization.
Capitalism.
Yeah, absolutely. 
We didn�t come here to see this in particular, but it makes me think about the act of seeing things that are rare. 
Why is it rare? 
It�s rare only because it has a lot of meaning, the bible itself has so much meaning in the past. 
But there are lots of things that are rare, we just don�t sanctify them and put them in these beautiful cases. 
There are 200 or so of these.
The personal also is rare. 

Is this your first time seeing a Gutenberg Bible?
Yes. 
Did you come here to see this specifically?
We were hoping to see this, yes!
Do any of you have past relationships with the bible, any bible?
Yeah, I was Mormon for a long time. 
I grew up very Catholic. 
So, the Catholic Bible. 
What is it like seeing this� ostensibly one of the first bibles?
I don�t particularly care about the fact that it�s a bible, just the fact that it�s as old as it is, and one of the first printed books. 
That�s really why I wanted to see it.
It�s the historical bit, as opposed to the religious bit, for me.
Same.
Is anything striking or surprising about it to you?
Just that it�s so old. 
It�s incredible that it survived.
Love it.

Did you come here to see the Gutenberg?
And what's your name?
I'm Abhishek.
Yes. 
I came here with my husband. 
Is this your first time seeing one?
Yes, that is correct. 
It�s obviously fascinating. 
Knowing that it�s the first time humanity started printing things. 
Personally, when I saw it I was trying to make sense of any of the words. 
I�m not sure, is it�like..
It�s Latin.
Ah. 
But it has phonetic marks�
Yeah, maybe diacritical marks� I�m not sure. 
I was wondering why this page in particular they decided to have it open on?
A team of conservationists comes here to turn the pages every couple weeks, I�m told. 
So the page is always changing. 
Probably for the health of the spine. 
I thought maybe it meant something that it was open on this page. 
I thought the same thing.
I thought maybe it was just random. 
Humans have a tendency to project certain things. 
Do you have a prior relationship with the bible?
Not really, I�m not a Christian. 
But I went to a convent school growing up. 
Back in India. 
It was St. Francis Desailes. 
So I obviously have read the bible and understand the importance of things associated with the bible. 
Like the commandments and creed. 
How it�s central to the faith. 
Also the stories associated with it. 
I grew up reading them. 
I know there are different versions, is this the old testament? 
It�s Latin of the Hebrew Old Testament. 
So then is this also a compiled document? 
Because when they made this, there must have been some existing book right before it, and they said �okay, lets compile this, or lets print this one.� 
That�s my other question.
So you�re thinking about the idea that this represents not the beginning, but more of a node�
Yeah totally. 
I think the value proposition of this piece is just that the printing revolution happened. 
Obviously religion was at the center of that civilization, so it makes sense that it was a bible. 
The other new information which I�ve been processing is that my husband comes from Macedonia, which is where orthodox christians are from. 
We went to one of these very beautiful villages. 
Lake ochrid. 
A lake in the mountains. 
There�s a monastery there. 
That�s where his language�s alphabet was developed. 
Cyrillic. 
The Slavic languages. 
Everything was verbal, spoken up until that point. 
So the common people could only understand things through the bible, because it was one of the very few literatures. 
I consider the bible literature, in the sense that it�s stories and information. 
It was the best tool for people to learn language. 
Literacy. 
So most of those developed through the bible. 
It was not the religious aspect, but the idea of being able to comprehend thoughts, projecting them and expressing them in the form of language. 
Not everyone understands Latin, so the best way to do it is whatever language everyone is speaking, give them some kind of form, and then a structure is evolved out of that. 
But, again, these are just random thoughts!
It�s very relevant. 
I like what you said about a value proposition. 
A Gutenberg Bible hasn�t sold at auction in about 50 years, so it�s interesting to think about its value today. 
Its value is a complete mystery. 
Value is an interesting topic, because the way knowledge of value of a certain piece if history is not because of the intrinsic value it holds, but what value somebody puts on it to acquire it. 
It�s probably not the best paper, or the best printing. 
But there�s probably some millionaire who grew up in a Christian family who�s like �I�ve read about this��
Or some bro [laughs]
Exactly, some bro, who is like �I�ve read about this! I have so much money now! I'm gonna buy it!� 
It�s very contextual in that sense, but I can understand what that value might be. 
Symbolic value. 
What is your profession?
So I�m a software engineer, by trade. 
I work with data. 
A lot of data which is generated online, companies need to find ways of making sense of that. 
Because it�s so big� it�s not like an excel sheet you can go over. I work with data scientists�
To sift through this data?
Yes so, for example, lets take the Gutenberg bible. 
Even though it�s a bible, and in most cases, its words mean things, and they have certain connotations, I would assume this would be exactly the same as any newer versions of bibles. 
But, lets say, whoever wrote the bible before this one, the last handwritten version, they copied this from that version. 
So if you want to figure out what kinds of nuances a human would miss, because a human has to read one line at a time, what you can do is literally take pictures of all the pages, pass it through a system�it�s probably over a million characters here. 
So my job would be to create those characters in a database and then there would be a data scientist who would be like, you know what, I think this model makes sense� let�s run this data through that model. 
And then he would figure out what the mistakes were. 
Micro-mistakes. 
There should be an �a� here, but they used a �b� for example. 
Human error. 
Anomalies?
Anomalies. 
But it can be anything. 
Like, maybe there�s a word you assume means something, because in the traditional space that word has some meaning, but probably that�s not what the original intent was. 
There may have been a different connotation associated with it. 
So my job essentially is working with data scientists to find information hidden in the data. 

What's your first name?
Theo
Is this your first time seeing a Gutenberg Bible?
How did it feel to see it for the first time?
I've only read about it and heard about it all my life.
And I didn't actually expect to see it here. 
I just happened to chance upon it. 
I mean, some of it's coming back now, what I read about it in school.
What the Gutenberg Bible was.
I can't remember but I think it was the first printed copy of the Bible.
I don't know how many prints there were.
About a hundred.
It used to take a scribe one whole year to make one whole book.
But it still took five years or so to make a hundred and ninety books.
The other thing that struck me was how recent it looks, even though it's so many centuries old.
It's in very good condition.
Also the type is very clear.
Much clearer than the printers today.
Very high-resolution, very crisp.
Do you have a relationship with the Bible?
For me, personally, I'm a practicing Christian. 
But if it's the first printed book for example, it would be of interest to me, not just because I'm a practicing Christian.
